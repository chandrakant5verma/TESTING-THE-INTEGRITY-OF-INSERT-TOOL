# TESTING-THE-INTEGRITY-OF-INSERT-TOOL
HERE WE COLLAB WITH MECHANICAL STUDENTS AND COLLECT DATA OF INSERT TOOLS TO MEASURE THE INTEGRITY OF INSTERT TOOLS HERE WE APPLIED Cnn DEEP LEARNING  MODEL FOR IT.
insert tool =   inserts tools are small insert made of cemented carbite, brace,DIAMOND hss which are used as the cutting edges for cutting tools such as tool holders for turning and face milling cutting for milling.
these tools are usually very costly and smooth in nature , a single scratch on it effect the manufactured machine. in this project we identified the the broken and workable insert tool
with the help of opencv and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) we also find how much effected tool can be workable.

here are some Broken and new insert tools for refrance:
